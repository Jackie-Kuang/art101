					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Using the headings and tags we learned in class, our goal for this assignment is to add a paragraph of an introduction of ourselves, reference an image into our website, and create a bulleted list of links that link our other website pages to our home page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When I was writing the code to create the list, I forgot how to properly write it. In each line I wrote a ul tag in front of each element so in the website, it created a horizontal list of links, not a  proper vertical list. So I looked back to my notes and realized within a ul tag, I have to write a li tag to tell that each item is a list item which solved my problem.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was relatively simple as it was just a lot of text and paragraph editing. Thinking about what to write in these paragraphs took up most of my effort. For the other things like referencing the images and creating the list to link our pages it was pretty easy to add so overall I felt really comfortable. </p>
