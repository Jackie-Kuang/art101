					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge for this assignment was to define variables for the car we own  in JavaScript and output them onto our website. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I encountered was that none of my JavaScript output was showing up on my website and I reread almost every single line from my HTML and JavaScript file trying to find the issue. In the end, something I was missing was defer in my code when linking my JavaScript and the only way I was able to find this was by comparing my code with my partner. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment overall was pretty straightforward for me and I was able to learn how to define variables and you can use them to calculate things like in this example the age of our car. But while this code was pretty simple, a small error can cause everything to break and I had to go through the process of troubleshooting for a long time.</p>
