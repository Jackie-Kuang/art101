	<h1>Hello World</h1>

	<p>My name is Jackie Kuang and I am from the Bay Area. I am an third year transfer, AGPM major. Some of my hobbies are working on cars and I'm into photography. I'm also really into things that are based on chance because I love the thrill of propability. My partner is Lavinia Chen and we are both in the same section. She is really interested in crocheting and to practice she makes animals. Like for Christmas she made me a penguin for my gift. Also we  met during this fall quarter, but we've become really good friends.</p>
