					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge for this lab is to create a button that toggles the style elements of a certain section of our website.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I had at the very beginning was when I was trying to view my basic page, not a single thing popped up in the live server. It was just a blank white page. So to solve this I redid my head section and relinked everything following the referece code on our homework in Canvas. Then after typing in the code in JavaScript to append the button and make it toggle, I realized the button never even showed up on in the challenge section. After relooking through all my code and checking console, I realized I never assigned an id to the challenge div so that's why the button never showed up. But after the button showed up, it waasn't applying the special style when I clicked it. Then I noticed I linked my css incorrectly because I just copied the example code from the homework which doesn't link the css correctly.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a fun assignment and doing interactive things like this using JavaScript to make buttons and seeing things change on the website makes it feel a lot more engaging.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Click the buttons to see the results!</p>
