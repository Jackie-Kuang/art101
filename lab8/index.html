			<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to use the console to practice using callbacks and anonymous functions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems with my index because I wasn't sure if I was linking my JavaScript correctly. Also within my JavaScript file I had an undefined main() and I was having headache with solving that issue because I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I compared my code to my partners and everything seemed to look the same, but someting I was missing was actually defining that function at the beginning.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thini once again I made some simple mistakes that made this lab turn into something much more complicated but I somehow managed to get my output to show up on my website and get everything to work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results of my code and shown below in the output:</p>
